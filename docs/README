README

Notes:
I've only tried this on Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit version.  No promises that it will work
on your version even if it's the same.


Requirements:
libusb-1.0
if you don't have it, you can get it by "sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0"

Java version 1.6 or higher

Download:
Download zip file from http://code.google.com/p/linux-g13-driver/downloads/list
Unzip into your favorite directory

Build:
Open a console (command prompt)
Go to the directory where you unzipped your download
type "make"


Running Application:
Run the config tool first!
	In a command prompt go to the directory where you unzipped your download
	and type "java -jar Linux-G13-GUI.jar"
	This will bring up the UI and create the initial files needed for your driver.
	All config files are saved in $(HOME)/.g13

Run the driver
	In a command prompt go to the directory where you unzipped your download
	and type "sudo ./Linux-G13-Driver"

If you are configuring the application while the driver is running, the driver will
not pick up changes unless you select a different bindings set or you can restart
the driver.

The top 4 buttons under the LCD screen select the bindings.

The joystick currently only supports key mappings.
